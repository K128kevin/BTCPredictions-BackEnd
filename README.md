Go Documentation: https://golang.org/doc/

https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1 - A good, very basic tutorial for Go that you can take online. It is interactive and all done in your browser, so you do not need to actually install Go to take this tutorial.

https://golang.org/doc/install - Installation instructions for Go

https://github.com/moovweb/gvm - Software for managing your version of Go. It makes it very easy to install and switch between versions. I highly recommend it.

I've generally found IntelliJ to be a good ide for Go (it has a go support plugin), and sublime is a good text editor (sublime has go support built in).
